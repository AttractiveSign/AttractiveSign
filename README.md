# 👋 Hi, I'm Jannis!

I'm a computer science student with a passion for tinkering across diverse projects — from software development to hardware and home automation. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and building small to medium-sized projects. Currently, I'm working on a Connect4-Bot written in Erlang for a Uni project
